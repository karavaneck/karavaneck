## Hi there 👋 I have no clue how to add an emoji to my code; GitHub did this automatically. 
Does this command make things invisible? <!-- test
Only if it appears as the first series of characters at the start of a line....testing now  
how do i get text to appear on a new line  
do two spaces at the end of the line actually work  
this is unbelievable  
two spaces = line break  
wow  
wow  
wow  
#NOW I WANT TO MAKE SOME HEADINGS
WITH ONE # PRECEDING MY HEADING, THE HEADING IS HUGE, #HUGE

THE HEADING IS ACTUALLY NOT HUGE, THE ASSISTANT SAYS I NEED TO ADD A SPACE TOO, SO I WILL TRY # HEADING TEST  
# HEADING TEST  
DID IT WORK? IT SHOWED UP BOLD IN MY EDIT! 
YAY! Now let's make some subheadings, just for fun using ## SUBHEADING  
## SUBHEADING (H2)
Now for some sub-sub-headings using ### SUB-SUB-HEADING  
### SUB-SUB-HEADING  (H3)
Now for some sub-sub-sub-headings using ### SUB-SUB-SUB-HEADING or maybe that's why they call it H4
#### SUB-SUB-SUB-HEADING (H4)

<!-- test
Only if it starts the line  

--> Do things appear after I close it with this -->
Yes!
I guess I'll use this read.me file to learn to code and record my findings herein. Yay!
