# README DAY 1

# STARTING FROM THE TOP NOW  
This way the newest code that I add to this Readme will be at the top. I left off with the whole emoji tangent and now I'm getting serious.  
After each topic or chapter, I will return to the top of the page.  
I will add a new heading each time I do so.  

## Hi there 👋 I have no clue how to add an emoji to my code; GitHub did this automatically. 
Does this command make things invisible? <!-- test
Only if it appears as the first series of characters at the start of a line....testing now  
how do i get text to appear on a new line  
do two spaces at the end of the line actually work  
this is unbelievable  
two spaces = line break  
wow  
wow  
wow  
<!-- test
Only if it starts the line  

--> Do things appear after I close it with this -->
Yes!
I guess I'll use this read.me file to learn to code and record my findings herein. Yay!

#NOW I WANT TO MAKE SOME HEADINGS
WITH ONE # PRECEDING MY HEADING, THE HEADING IS HUGE, #HUGE

THE HEADING IS ACTUALLY NOT HUGE, THE ASSISTANT SAYS I NEED TO ADD A SPACE TOO, SO I WILL TRY # HEADING TEST  
# HEADING TEST  
DID IT WORK? IT SHOWED UP BOLD IN MY EDIT! 
YAY! Now let's make some subheadings, just for fun using ## SUBHEADING  
## SUBHEADING (H2)
Now for some sub-sub-headings using ### SUB-SUB-HEADING  
### SUB-SUB-HEADING  (H3)
Now for some sub-sub-sub-headings using ### SUB-SUB-SUB-HEADING or maybe that's why they call it H4
#### SUB-SUB-SUB-HEADING (H4)
Apparently this can go all the way down to H6, and maybe smaller? Let's try H7 ####### H7  
####### H7
######## H8  
###### H6 - H6 is the smallest I guess

Quick usage tips  

In headings: # 🌲🌳🌿 Emoji Forest 
In lists/rows: copy-paste glyphs directly (e.g., 🌲 🌳 🌴 🌵 🌱 🌿) — GitHub will render them.  
Shortcodes (e.g., :seedling:, :evergreen_tree:) also work in normal Markdown text on GitHub but not inside fenced code blocks. If you want shortcodes I can add the common ones next to each item.  

  Now I wanna try to make a few of these emojis, like the bouquet so i will type u{1F490}, that did not work, so i will type \u{1F490}
, which also did not work  
U+1F490  did not work either, but now the assistant is telling me to press windows +. ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍💔❣💕💞💓💗💖💘💝💟💌💢💥💤💦💨💫🕳☮✝ that begin with LOVE LOVE LOVE!  
So to review, hold down the windows key and then tap the period key ( . ) and the Windows emoji picker will pop up, if I were using a Mac, I would press Control + Command + Space to open the emoji viewer.  
🌳🌴🍃🌾🌿🍀🌲🌱☘🥀🌷🌼🌻🌺🌹🏵🌸💐 and they are so beautiful. But why did the assistant even tell me those codes? 

GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant — short answer: those “codes” are different representations of the same emoji, but only some get turned into a visible emoji in rendered Markdown.  
You likely pasted the literal escape sequences (U+1F331, "\u{1F331}", etc.) into README.md — those are not converted into glyphs by the Markdown renderer.  

Why each form behaves differently  

Glyph (🌱): the actual emoji character. Paste this directly into your Markdown text and GitHub will render it. This is the simplest, most reliable method.  
GitHub shortcode (:seedling:): GitHub converts these shortcodes into emoji when they appear in normal Markdown text (not inside code). Works only on GitHub’s renderer.  
HTML numeric entity (🌱 or 🌱): the Markdown -> HTML pipeline will convert these into the emoji glyph in rendered view.  
Unicode code point text (U+1F331): plain text; it’s not a glyph and won’t be converted.  
Language escape ("\u{1F331}", "\U0001F331", "\uD83C\uDF31"): these are string escapes for programming languages.  
They only become an emoji when interpreted by that language/runtime (e.g., JS or Python) — not by Markdown.  
Inside code blocks or inline code: shortcodes, entities, and glyphs are shown literally (no conversion).   
Don’t put emojis inside backticks if you want them rendered.  
Correct examples you can paste into README.md  

Direct glyph (recommended): # 🌲 Emoji Forest  
Shortcode (GitHub markdown): # :evergreen_tree: Emoji Forest  
HTML entity: # 🌲 Emoji Forest  
Incorrect examples (won’t render as emoji)  

U+1F331 Seedling  
"\u{1F331}" Seedling  
In a code block:  
md  
# :seedling:  
Other practical tips  

Use your OS emoji picker to insert glyphs: Windows: Win + . (period); Mac: Ctrl + Cmd + Space.  
Ensure README.md is saved as UTF-8 (most editors/ GitHub do this by default).  
If emoji look blank, the issue may be the viewer’s font/OS support — try another browser or device.  
Variation selectors: some emojis (like ☘️) include a VS16 (U+FE0F) to force emoji style; rarely matters on GitHub.
